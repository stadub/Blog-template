In case you were wondering, not that I have any reason to believe you were, *Haacked* is *not* my real name. _Haacked_ started off as my my [blogger handle](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/03/12/what-is-your-blogger-handle.aspx "What’s your blogger handle?"). It's a play of my last name and I use it everywhere: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/haacked), [GitHub](https://github.com/haacked), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/598/haacked), [LinkedIn](https://https://www.linkedin.com/in/haacked/), and so on.

It also forms the basis for [my company name, Haacked LLC](https://haacked.com/archive/2019/01/07/haacked-llc/).

## What I do

I mentor and advise software organizations to help them become the best versions of themselves. I enjoy helping organizations become more effective through better management and better development workflows. It's important to me to provide tools and systems to teams so they can improve at scale.

Before I started Haacked LLC, I worked at [GitHub](http://github.com/) doing whatever I could [to make it even more awesome](https://haacked.com/archive/2018/12/18/leaving-github/). Prior to that I worked at Microsoft on [NuGet](http://nuget.org) and [ASP.NET MVC](https://www.asp.net/mvc) and helped to usher in Microsoft's Open Source era.

## Why I do it

Ever since I first laid my hands on [my first computer](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/06/06/my-first-computer.aspx "This was my first computer"), a TRS-80, *aka Trash 80*, I’ve loved computers and all the wonderful things you can make them do such as printing `Care to play a game?` in an infinite loop.

I also have a passion for managing and developing Open Source projects. There’s something immensely satisfying in working with developers all over the world on a common goal, and then sharing that product with all comers.

I also enjoy helping companies that write software become more effective at it. Often, it's not the lack of technical know-how that holds teams back, but the lack of management and leadership skills that get in the way.

## What I do for fun

What is it about American culture that causes us to ask people *What do you do?* and mean *What is your occupation?* rather than *What do you do for fun?*. And here I go propagating that mindset by putting this section last.

Oh well. Read my blog for a while and you’ll find I’m fanatical about playing soccer.

Living in beautiful Bellevue, WA, I take every occasion to go hiking and camping.
