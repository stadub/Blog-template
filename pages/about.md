In case you were wondering, not that I have any reason to believe you were, *Haacked* is *not* my real name. _Haacked_ started off as my [blogger handle](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/03/12/what-is-your-blogger-handle.aspx "What’s your blogger handle?"). It's probably no surprise that it's a play off my last name (Haack) and I use it everywhere: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/haacked), [GitHub](https://github.com/haacked), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/598/haacked), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haacked/), and so on.

It also forms the basis for [my company name, Haacked LLC](https://haacked.com/archive/2019/01/07/haacked-llc/). As for me, my real name is Phil Haack. Nice to meet you!

The best way to reach me is to DM me on Twitter. For work inquiries, email [phil@haacked.com](mailto:phil@haacked.com).

## What I do

I coach software organizations to help them become the best versions of themselves. Often, it's not the lack of technical know-how that holds teams back, but the lack of management and leadership skills that get in the way. When I help teams in this way, it's important that I leave them with tools and systems in place to scale their growth and learning.

Before I started Haacked LLC, I worked at [GitHub](http://github.com/) doing whatever I could [to make it even more awesome](https://haacked.com/archive/2018/12/18/leaving-github/). Prior to that I worked at Microsoft on [NuGet](http://nuget.org) and [ASP.NET MVC](https://www.asp.net/mvc) and helped to usher in Microsoft's Open Source era.

I'm also a [published author of several technical books](https://www.amazon.com/Phil-Haack/e/B005G0TNRU/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1546924429&sr=8-1) and a regular international speaker.

## Why I do it

Ever since I first laid my hands on [my first computer](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/06/06/my-first-computer.aspx "This was my first computer"), a TRS-80, *aka Trash 80*, I’ve loved computers and all the wonderful things you can make them do such as printing `Care to play a game?` in an infinite loop.

I also have a passion for managing and developing Open Source projects. There’s something immensely satisfying in working with developers all over the world on a common goal, and then sharing that product with all comers.

## What I do for fun

What is it about American culture that causes us to ask people *What do you do?* and mean *What is your occupation?* rather than *What do you do for fun?*. And here I go propagating that mindset by putting this section last.

Oh well. Read my blog for a while and you’ll find I’m fanatical about playing soccer. I live in beautiful Bellevue, WA which has abundant hiking and camping opportunities. I also love to travel and listen to music with great beats way too loud.

In my spare time, I continue the Quixotic battle to correct the capitalization of "Github" to "GitHub" wherever I can.
