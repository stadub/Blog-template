In case you were wondering, not that I have any reason to believe you were, *Haacked* is *not* my real name.

In the offline world, *(which some prefer to call the “real world”)*, people tend to call me [Phil Haack](https://haacked.com/ "home page") *(pronounced, you guessed it, “hack”)* — unless of course they are calling me more colorful names as is sometimes deserved.

*Haacked* is simply my [blogger handle](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/03/12/what-is-your-blogger-handle.aspx "What’s your blogger handle?") *(creative, eh?)*. I also go by [@haacked](http://twitter.com/haacked) on Twitter

## What I do

I'm a [stay-at-home parent and independent malcontent](https://twitter.com/haacked/status/1053296117176184834).

I used to work at [GitHub](http://github.com/) doing whatever I could to make it even more awesome. Prior to that I worked at Microsoft on [NuGet](http://nuget.org) and [ASP.NET MVC](https://www.asp.net/mvc) and helped to usher in Microsoft's Open Source era.

## Why I do it

Ever since I first laid my hands on [my first computer](https://haacked.com/archive/2005/06/06/my-first-computer.aspx "This was my first computer"), a TRS-80, *aka Trash 80*, I’ve loved computers and all the wonderful things you can make them do such as printing `Care to play a game?` in an infinite loop.

I also have a passion for managing and developing Open Source projects. There’s something immensely satisfying in working with developers all over the world on a common goal, and then sharing that product with all comers.

I also enjoy helping companies that write software become more effective at it. Often, it's not the lack of technical know-how that holds teams back, but the lack of management and leadership skills that get in the way.

## What I do for fun

What is it about American culture that causes us to ask people *What do you do?* and mean *What is your occupation?* rather than *What do you do for fun?*. And here I go propagating that mindset by putting this section last.

Oh well. Read my blog for a while and you’ll find I’m fanatical about playing soccer.

Living in beautiful Bellevue, WA, I take every occasion to go hiking and camping.
