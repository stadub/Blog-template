If I had to pick only one trait I hope to instill in my children, it's empathy. It's on my mind because of [this beautiful post by Reg Braythwayt](http://braythwayt.com/2014/03/17/empathy.html).

> Empathy is not seeing the world with your eyes from where someone else is standing, it’s seeing the world with their eyes, from their perspective, coloured with their hopes and fears, their life experience.

> Empathy is putting yourself in someone else’s shoes and then overcoming your own thoughts of what you would do in their shoes and imagining what it feels like to be them in their shoes.

You'll note the unnecessary "u" in "coloured". Reg is Canadian, but don't let that stop you from reading the whole post. It's brief but wonderful.

In fact, it's so good, part of the point of my blog post is to draw attention to his post. Especially the iconic image in his post that is a powerful illustration of real empathy.

But when you read that description of empathy, it sounds kind of, well, painful. Why would anyone want to be empathetic? How do you explain the benefit to someone who's not inclined to be empathetic?

__My answer is self-interest.__ It's in any given person's best interests to be empathetic.

To explain, allow me to indulge in a brief philosophical digression. The source I'll quote from is a masterpiece of philosophy, the television show known as Friends. Friends was a popular ensemble sitcom that ran for a decade starting in 1994. Click on the image for a clip from the episode entitled "The one where Phoebe hates PBS."

[![joey_and_phoebe](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/19977/2456543/a9ad4414-af1b-11e3-9fae-dbe35626e081.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShF71WE75UU)

In this episode Joey claims there is no such thing as a selfless good deed. Phoebe disagrees and attempts to prove there is. But each attempt is unsuccessful because they all provide some benefit to her. [The Wikia summary](http://friends.wikia.com/wiki/The_One_Where_Phoebe_Hates_PBS) describes what happens next:

> Because she fails at all her attempts, she decides to donate $200 to PBS, because "they bring happiness to lots of kids whose moms didn't kill themselves", and she won the bet. However, this donations leads to Joey being the volunteer which broke last year's record, so he finally gets on TV; which makes Phoebe happy.

I'm not one to take my philosophical cues from a pop-culture television show, but this does happen to align with my own philosophy. Every selfless act provides some benefit to the giver. But note, I also don't think this is a bad thing. There's a difference between selfish and self-interested. This doesn't mean that I only care for others because I benefit. What it means though, is that when I do care for others, I do benefit.

I think empathy is that way. There's a tangible benefit. I shudder to think of being a person who can only experience the world through my own perspective. That would be such a monochromatic world. More concretely, I think it would be a sad and frustrating to always see others as the "them". Where I characterize other groups as lazy, dishonest, untrustworthy.

With empathy, I realize that we're all just squirrels trying to get a nut in this world. That most people aren't focused on how they can harm me. They're focused on how they can take care of theirs. We're all alike in this way. And that's a comforting thought.

It also allows us to make better decisions in our relationships which makes us happier.

This isn't the first time I've written about empathy and won't be the last. You might find my other posts that talk about empathy in various contexts helpful.

* [Building an Open Source Community requires empathy](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/03/26/building-a-strong-open-source-community-requires-empathy.aspx/) where I talk about having empathy for your users as well as a thick skin.
* [You don't need a thick skin](http://haacked.com/archive/2012/12/17/you-do-not-need-a-thick-skin.aspx/) where I contradict myself and suggest maybe you don't need a thick skin.
* [Reflective Parenting](http://haacked.com/archive/2013/05/27/reflective-parenting.aspx/) where I talk about empathy's role in parenting.

Now it's easy to talk about empathy to those who want to be more empathetic. But if we get down to it, why? Why would I want my children to be empathetic? What's the benefit?
