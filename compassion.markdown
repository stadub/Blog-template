Yesterday I chaperoned my son's 1st grade field trip to the Bellevue Botanical Gardens. It's surprising they'd just trust me with that responsibility but I guess the fact I've kept my children alive this long makes me qualified.

Also, there were four other parents and two adult guides. A total of seven adults for a group of fourteen kids. So maybe they didn't trust me that much after all.

The theme for the trip was "flower power." But rather than learn about passive resistance and non-violent protest (the kids are already good at that), they learned about the parts of the flower and how all of it works together with pollinators to keep the whole cycle going.

The reason I write about this was to describe a specific moment. The kids were seated and the guide passed around plastic examples of pollinators. So there's a bee, a beetle, and so on. But these were oversized plastic models.

As the kids start passing them out, one of the boys starts freaking the hell out screaming in fear. At first, it seemed he was making a joke that the giant bugs scared him. But it was soon clear he was experiencing real terror.

The guide suggested he go stand near the parents and I waved him over to me. My son is his friend and he's been to my house for play dates so I figured he'd be comforted by being next to someone he knows. So instead of a bug pollinator, he got the pinwheel which represented wind. Which we know is very good at getting that sticky yellow crap all over your stuff.

Later in the trip, we end up at the visitor center and another guide, a former teacher, has the kids sit cross legged on the floor as she quizzes them about what they've learned. She starts to show photos of pollinators and when she shows a bee, the young boy again starts screaming in terror.

At this point, I'm ashamed to say, I had an instantaneous knee jerk internal reaction that this kid needs to toughen up and get a grip. But I suppressed that and tried to empathize with him.

But an amazing thing happened as us adults stood there slack jawed not sure what to do. Rather than tease or laugh at his reaction, the boy in front of him stood up straighter. By now the scared boy had his head in the boy in front's back.

The girl next to that boy scooted closer to block his view of the photos.

At the same time, the boy behind the scared boy rested his hand on the scared boy's back and whispered, "Don't look now" and "Ok, you can look now." It was clear these kids had experienced this reaction before and they responded tenderly with compassion and care.

I nearly cried right then and there. I felt ashamed at my own initial gut reaction. Our culture is pretty fucked up when you think about. We tell boys it's not ok to be afraid. It's not ok to cry as if this is some universal truth.

But a cursory reading of historical texts demonstrates this is a cultural construct, and an unhealthy one at that. The Old Testament is rife with men weeping. Old Japanese and European epics are full of the manliest heroes crying buckets. Even if I accepted this cultural construct, applying the same level of stoicism to a six year old just seems harsh.

These kids showed me what true empathy and compassion is. The tragedy is that over the next few years, socialization, media, etc. will destroy that pure compassion and empathy they exhibited until they're snarky and mean spirited like I was. I hope to fight that influence on my kids every step of the way. If they can retain the ounce of caring these six year olds naturally have, it would do a lot of good.
