**What? Why Have A Privacy Policy?**
 Well, you wouldn't want Haacked.com sharing all sorts of deeply
personal information about you, would you? Well of course not. Besides,
some affiliate programs require a privacy policy. So here you go, a
privacy policy.

**Besides Your Rear, What Does The Policy Cover?** 
 This privacy policy covers how Haacked.com treats personal information
it receives from visitors. It gives the average reader the assurance
that his or her personal information is safe from Big Brother and other
prying eyes.

**How Do You Guarantee Privacy?**
 As in life, there are no perfect guarantees. However, as Haacked.com
doesn't require registration, it really doesn't have much information to
share in the first place.

**What Information Do You Collect?**
 That's just it, there's hardly any information to collect. About the
only personal information this site may have about you is anything you
disclose within the comments section of the site or via the Contact Us
page. Regarding the comments, that information is publicly available as
it is displayed on the site. If you don't want it displayed, don't
comment. Or make up false information. Haacked.com has no way of
knowing.

**What About Cookies?**
 Haacked.com automatically receives and records information in its
server logs from your browser, including your IP Address, cookie
information (should you request to be remembered), and the page you
request. This information is used to generate aggregate statistics such
as the # of users, visits, etc... This is a function of the blogging
engine (Subtext).

**So Who Do You Share This Information With?**
 Absolutely nobody.

**Even If I Offered You 10 Million Dollars?**
 Let's talk off-line in private.... er... I mean NO! Absolutely Not.
Haacked.com doesn't gather any information worth selling.
